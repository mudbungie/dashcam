Okay, so the main idea here is to have a system for recording a series of video files. Upload them to the server whenever able, though that's going to be based on whether or not the system is connected to a wifi network with internet access.

Components:
    Record:
        Records video.
        Loops at some duration.
        Deletes the oldest video when over a specified disk usage.
    Upload:
        When a condition is met, upload to server.
            When connected to specific wifi network?
            Whenever there is an uplink?
        Has to upload only what's new.
            Everything's sequential, so it might be reasonable to just have a 
                latest sent marker, which advances.
                Problem: never trust clients.
            Store a boolean flag of everything that has not uploaded.
                Problem: never trust clients.
            Send JSON/XML/list of all files, sever asks for whatever.
                Problem: list becomes large.
                    Solution, only send most recent some.
                        Also, maybe purge old records. 
    Server:
        Authenticates sources.
        Receives videos.
            Needs to not accept videos that already exist.
        Deletes videos after a certain storage limit.
            The feature to never finish, lol
